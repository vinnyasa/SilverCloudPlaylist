# SilverCloudPlaylist

An iOS app for creating local Spotify playlists using Spotify API and authentication. 
Authentication is also using a server to hide secret key.
You can search in Spotify to create playlists.
Has a nice graphic interface that imports cover art for songs and albums. 

See included images :)

*You would need to create your own client in Spotify to create your own app.
